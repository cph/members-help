Visits are an important part of ministering to a congregation. Whether
making a visit to the hospital to encourage or provide communion to an
ailing member, stopping in to provide council to a family, or making a
welcoming visit to new members or visitors of the church, Pastoral
Visits provides a place to enter a record of these visits: ![Pastoral
