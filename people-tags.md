In 360Members, Tags are used to identify groups or categories
that people belong to. They are meant to have a "free-flowing" nature,
and will be different for each church's database: ![The Tags
page](images/People_Tags_01.JPG "The Tags page")

### Examples of Tags

Some common examples of groups or categories that a church may set up as
Tags are:

-   ***Activity Groups***: These could be church activities, such as
    Adult Choir, Greeters, Altar Guild, Church Council, Ushers, members
    of a certain small group bible study. They could also be used to
    show members of non-church activity groups, such as children who
    participate in the town's Little League, or Town Council members.
-   ***Skills***: Used to identify both church skills (Worship Banner
    Makers, Bulletin/Newsletter Assemblers, those who can run the
    Powerpoint and projector for the Contemporary service) and outside
    church skills (Accounting, Desktop Publishing, Landscaping).
-   ***Training groups***: Those who are part of a learning group, such
    as members of a New Members' orientation class, a Confirmation
    class, those being trained as Ushers.
-   ***Elder assigned***: Set up groups for each elder (Elder-John
    Smith, Elder-Chris Walker). The people who are assigned to each
    elder can be given the tag for that elder.
-   ***Occupations***: A tag can be created for each occupation that
    people in the database hold (i.e.: Software Engineer, College
    Professor, Homemaker).
-   ***Military Status***: Active Duty, Reverses, Veterans--create tags
    for each status you wish to track.
-   ***School information***: You can set up tags for each school that
    people are currently attending or that people have attended; or for
    each type of degree or certification that people may hold (Masters
    in Law, MSCE certification).

Again, the list above contains some examples of the type of Tags that
may be set up by an individual church. Most churches will have other
tags which they set up for their own groups and categories.
