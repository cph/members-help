 The people view displays the selected person records,
showing the columns or fields selected in the **Columns** settings (See
the [[Columns and Reports|people-View#Columns-and-Reports]]
section below for details): ![An overview of the People View
page.](images/People_View_01.JPG "An overview of the People View page.")

To [[open a person record|people-Profile-View]], click on that
person's name: ![Clicking on a
person.](images/People_View_02.JPG "Clicking on a person.")

To [[open a household record|people-Edit-a-Household]], click on
the household name (Note: If not seeing a Household column, you may need
to select Household as one of your selected columns under the
**Columns** settings): ![Clicking on a
household.](images/People_View_03.JPG "Clicking on a household.")

The page controls at the top right and bottom right of the screen allow
you to move between the pages of your households. **\<\< Previous**
moves back one screen; **Next \>\>** moves forward one screen; clicking
on a **Page Number** goes to that page: ![Page
Controls](images/People_View_04.JPG "Page Controls")

Note: People list in groups of 20 per page.

You can type in the **Type to filter results** box to search for name or
part of a person's name: ![Filtering the
list](images/People_View_05.JPG "Filtering the list")

For example, entering *be* in the filter box will change the people list
to only show those people with the letters *be* contained in their name.

checkbox to the left of their name: ![Selecting multiple

report](images/People_View_13.JPG "Saving changes to an existing report")

##### To load a previously saved report:

the People header). This may show the word **Custom** if a report has
not previously been loaded, or it will show the name of the report
