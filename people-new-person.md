 The New Person page allows you to add new people records
into your database: ![An overview of the New Person
page.](New_Person_01.JPG "An overview of the New Person page.")

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic process for adding a new person record is to fill in the
fields with known information, then click the **Add Person** button at
the lower right of the screen. The following information on this page
deals with the details for doing so. Make sure you understand which
fields are required, and how person and household records are created
before proceeding.

List of Person Fields
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Title**: Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Rev, or Rev Dr
-   **First Name**: Formal first name (i.e.: Robert)
-   **Middle Name**: An initial is also acceptable
-   **Last Name**: Note that this does not need to match the household
    name (i.e.: "Jane Smith" can be a member of "The John Doe
    Household")
-   **Suffix**: Select from Jr, Sr, II, III
-   **Preferred Name**: Informal first name or nickname (i.e.: Bob)
-   **Household**: The **Household** that this person is a member. To
    determine how to complete the Household field, see the instructions
    below in the [Person and Household
    Records](people:%20New%20Person#Person%20and%20Household%20Records)
    section below.
-   **Status**: Member status; your options here will vary, depending on
    the denomination of your Church.
-   **Sex**: Male or Female
-   **Ethnic Group**: Select a category

The following fields are required when adding a person: **Title, First
Name, Last Name, Status, Sex,** and **Ethnic Group**. Note: These fields
are highlighted in the screen image at the top of this help page.

Person and Household Records
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When adding a new person, users should be aware of how their Household
record will be determined; there are two options:

### 1. Adding a Person to an Existing Household:

Perform a lookup and selection of an existing household record, by
entering that household name in the **Household** field and clicking on
the appropriate household: ![Looking up Existing
Household](New_Person_02.JPG "Looking up Existing Household")

After selecting the Household from the lookup list, its Contact
Information will load in the lower portion of the screen. Fill out the
remaining personal information, then click the **Add Person** button to
add the new person both to your database and as a Member of that
existing Household Record: ![Adding Person to Existing
Household](New_Person_03.JPG "Adding Person to Existing Household")

### 2. Adding a Person and Creating a New Household (at the same time):

When entering the new Person's information, leave the **Household**
field in the top portion of the page blank: ![Leave Household field
blank](New_Person_04.JPG "Leave Household field blank")

Fill in the Contact Information, then click the **Add Person** button:
![Enter Contact
Information](New_Person_05.JPG "Enter Contact Information")

The new Person record will be added to your database and a new Household
Record will also be created. The person will also automatically be added
as a Member of this Household Record.

\<\\!-- ===3. Adding a Person Record only (without making the person a
Member of a Household)=== When entering the new Person's information,
leave the **Household** field in the top portion of the page blank:
![Leave Household field
blank](New_Person_06.JPG "Leave Household field blank")

Leave all fields in the **Contact Information** section blank, then
click the Add Person button: ![Blank Contact
Information](New_Person_07.JPG "Blank Contact Information")

Therefore, it is possible to have a person record in *Church360Â°* who
is not assigned to a specific household. This is often an easy method
for entering Visitors into your database on their first visit, where you
may not have all of their contact and family information ready to enter.
Note: It is possible to later add such a person record to a household
record by [editing a Household record](people:%20Edit%20a%20Household),
and adding the person under the Members of the Household section. --\>
