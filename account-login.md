If you are unable to login, check the following:

-   Are you accessing the correct web page? Make sure that the web
    address you are entering is the correct one for your church. Your
    login credentials will only work at your Church360° website.
-   If your ***username or email address*** is correct, and your
    ***password*** is not working, click on ***Forgot your password?***:

![The Forgot your password?
screen](images/Forgot_Password.JPG "The Forgot your password? screen")

-   You will be taken to a page where you can enter ***your email
    address*** and click ***Go***. An email will be sent to that email
    address with instructions for resetting your Church360° password.
    If you have an epiphany while you are on the *Forgot Your Password?*
    screen and suddenly remember your password, click the ***No, wait, I
    remembered.*** link to return to the main login screen.
-   When checking your email account for the message with instructions
    for resetting your Church360° password, make sure to check both
    your Inbox folder and your Spam folder. It is possible that your
    Internet Service Provider might treat the reset mail as spam,
    placing the message in a spam folder instead of your regular inbox
    folder.
-   If you are still unable to login, contact Concordia Technology
    Solutions technical support. Technicians can be reached via email
    at: [mailto:support@cts.cph.org], or via phone at: 1-800-346-6120.

Settings|settings-View]] area and marked the checkbox to ***Show my
church's logo*** that logo will appear above the login fields.
