### Editing an Event

To edit an event record, click on the event in either the [Monthly
View](events:%20View) or the [Weekly
View](events:%20View#Changing%20Your%20View) page. Update any field for
the event, then click the **Save** button at the lower right of the
screen. To exit without saving your changes, click the **Cancel** button
at the lower right. ![Editing an
Event.](Events_Edit_01.JPG "Editing an Event.")

The following fields are required for each event: **Event Name**,
**Calendar**, **Start Date**, **End Date**, **Repeats** (Repeats should
be set to *Never* for all non-recurring events).

In addition, each Event must have either a **Start Time** and an **End
Time**, or the Event must be scheduled as an **All Day** Event.

    database. New Calendars can be created by clicking on Calendars
    under the Events menu (on the left side of the screen).

    that this field is optional and may be left blank.

        OR that the event **Does Not End**. The **+** sign allows you to
