## People: Households

Household records are created in Church 360° automatically when:

-   A new person is added to the system and an address is entered.
-   An address is added to a person record who previously had no address
    (from a person's profile page).

*Note: Since household records are created automatically by the above
methods, there is not a link or page in Church 360° to add a new
household.*

The main Households page displays a list of your current
Households with selected contact information: ![An overview of the
